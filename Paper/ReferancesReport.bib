  abstract = {MEMS accelerometers have received attention owing to their low cost and small size. Accurate vibration measurements of both amplitude and phase, in the measurement frequency range, are important for reliable vibration analysis. However, a number of MEMS accelerometers from different manufacturers show some deviation, in amplitude and phase, when examined using controlled vibration laboratory measurements. This paper presents a method to improve MEMS accelerometers performance. Through the laboratory measurements, a characteristic function (CF) for a typical MEMS accelerometer has been calculated, with reference to a standard accelerometer. Using the CF, a filter has been designed for the MEMS accelerometer, which corrects for amplitude and phase deviation.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring the safety of structures. A shift of SHM research away from traditional wired methods toward the use of wireless smart sensors (WSS) has been motivated by the attractive features of wireless smart sensor networks (WSSN). The progress achieved in Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies and wireless data transmission, has extended the effectiveness and range of applicability of WSSNs. One of the most common sensors employed in SHM strategies is the accelerometer; however, most accelerometers in WSS nodes have inadequate resolution for measurement of the typical accelerations found in many SHM applications. In this study, a high-resolution and low-noise tri-axial digital MEMS accelerometer is incorporated in a next-generation WSS platform, the Xnode. In addition to meeting the acceleration sensing demands of large-scale civil infrastructure applications, this new WSS node provides powerful hardware and a robust software framework to enable edge computing that can deliver actionable information. Hardware and software integration challenges are presented, and the associate resolutions are discussed. The performance of the wireless accelerometer is demonstrated experimentally through comparison with high-sensitivity wired accelerometers. This new high-sensitivity wireless accelerometer will extend the use of WSSN to a broader class of SHM applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new fabrication approach and design for a three axis capacitive MEMS accelerometer that is capable of measuring externally applied accelerations in three orthogonal axes. Individual lateral and vertical axis accelerometers are fabricated in the same die on an SOI wafer which is anodically bonded to a glass substrate. Handle layer of the SOI wafer is used as the top electrode for the vertical axis accelerometer. This accelerometer has a 2mm2 perforated electrode area anchored to the glass substrate by four beams. The lateral axis accelerometers on the other hand, have comb finger structures with a 2.7×4.2mm device size and anchored to the glass substrate by six folded beams. Rest capacitance of the vertical axis accelerometer is designed to be 8.8pF, and it is 10.2pF for the lateral axis accelerometers. The system level performance results are obtained using analog readout circuitry integrated to each axis separately. The x- and y-axis accelerometers show a noise floor and bias instability equal or better than 13.9μg/√Hz and 17μg, respectively, while the z-axis accelerometer shows 17.8μg/√Hz noise floor and 36μg bias instability values.},

  abstract = {An experimental modal coupling method is investigated by applying it to a large structure tested by parts. The method is based on testing different parts of the structure with their interface coordinates loaded with rigid, heavy dummy masses. With these boundary masses, the low frequency modes contain local deformations near the interface and thus can be used to obtain accurate dynamic properties of the assembled structure. The applicability and accuracy of this method are demonstrated by coupling the measured modal properties of two substantially different structural components, both tested with the same boundary mass. The test data is obtained with simple standard excitation and data acquisition means. The resulting modal properties of the assembled structure are shown to be in good agreement with those of a finite element model that was tuned to match the dynamic properties of the individual parts.},

  abstract       = {This paper presents a novel method of procuring and processing data for the assessment of civil structures via vibration monitoring. This includes the development of a custom sensor package designed to minimize the size/weight while being fully self-sufficient (i.e., not relying on external power). The developed package is delivered to the structure utilizing a customized Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), otherwise known as a drone. The sensor package features an electropermanent magnet for securing it to the civil structure while a second magnet is used to secure the package to the drone during flight. The novel B-Spline Impulse Response Function (BIRF) technique was utilized to extract the Dynamic Signature Response (DSR) from the data collected by the sensor package. Experimental results are presented to validate this method and show the feasibility of deploying the sensor package on structures and collecting data valuable for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) data processing. The advantages and limitations of the proposed techniques are discussed, and recommendations for further developments are made.},

This study develops a wireless cable tension monitoring system using MEMSIC’s Imote2 smart sensors. The monitoring system features autonomous operation, sustainable energy harvesting and power consumption, and remote access using the internet. To obtain the tension force, an in-network data processing strategy associated with the vibration-based tension estimation method is implemented on the Imote2-based sensor network, significantly reducing the wireless data transmission and the power consumption. The proposed monitoring system has been deployed and validated on the Jindo Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge located in South Korea.},

  abstract = {This article presents the development and the results of 1 year of implementation of a simple vibration-based structural health monitoring system for preventive conservation and condition-based maintenance of an Italian monumental masonry bell-tower. The system is based on the data recorded by a small number of high-sensitivity accelerometers, on remote automated frequency tracking and on a multivariate statistical analysis criterion for damage detection, combining data regression, principal component analysis, and novelty analysis. The analysis of monitoring data highlights the main characteristics of the response of the tower to wind, swinging bells, and low-return period earthquakes. Despite the low levels of vibration in operational conditions, the system is seen able to track the time evolution of five natural frequencies of the structure and successfully use such information for detecting anomalous deviations from normal conditions. More in general, the presented results show a promise toward a more widespread use of low-cost vibration-based monitoring systems for cultural heritage preservation.},
